Title:  Hotel Reservation

Description:  Using a few things learned during the MySQL portion of NuCamp's bootcamp, I chose to explore creating the schema, design, etc. for a mock hotel reservation system

API Reference Table of endpoint paths, methods, parameters: TBD

Retrospective answering of the following questions:

How did the project's design evolve over time? I began by creating the database design using the draw.io extension inside of Visual Studio Code to visualize the different aspects of the schema. I then moved on to actually creating the queries needed to construct the tables within the database. As we began learning about endpoints, ORM vs. raw SQL, and optimization choices, these facets came into play as well.

Did you choose to use an ORM or raw SQL? Why?  Raw SQL - small database design made it an ideal choice along with search optimization (less translations/conversions)

What future improvements are in store, if any?  Probably building additional tables for various features, experimenting with populating it with dummy data, and creating/sharing queries that could be useful to clients/consumers of the database
